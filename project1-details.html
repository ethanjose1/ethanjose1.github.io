            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>During my IST387 data science class, we were tasked with being a consultant for a made-up energy company based in North Carolina and South Carolina. Our goal was to explore factors related to energy usage and make scientific predictions based on a 5-degree increase in temperature to prepare for climate change.</p>
            
            <h3>Business Questions Addressed:</h3>
            <ol class="business-questions">
                <li>What factors relate to the consumption of energy in North Carolina and South Carolina?</li>
                <li>What factors relate to the cooling of different types of homes during the hot months of the summer?</li>
                <li>What climate factors strongly correlate to energy efficiency?</li>
                <li>What physical factors relating to a house correlate to energy efficiency? (e.g., square footage, layout, windows)</li>
                <li>What types of insulation and building materials correlate to higher energy usage?</li>
                <li>What are the most important factors to be concerned about given a five-degree increase in average temperature?</li>
            </ol>
